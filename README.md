# Airline Crew Scheduling Optimizer

Optimization project for airline crew scheduling using **Set Covering Problem (SCP)**, **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**, and **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**.  
The project analyzes flightâ€“pairing datasets, formulates crew pairing as an SCP, and evaluates classical optimization (ILP) against evolutionary optimization (GA) in terms of solution quality and computation time.

##  Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed flightâ€“pairing dataset for cost structures and coverage.  
   - Visualized distributions, flight frequencies, and pairing feasibility.  

2. **Set Covering Formulation**  
   - Modeled crew scheduling as a **Set Covering Problem (SCP)**.  
   - Solved using **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** via PuLP.  

3. **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**  
   - Developed a GA with selection, crossover, and mutation operators using DEAP.  
   - Scaled SCP to larger problem sizes where ILP becomes computationally expensive.  

4. **Comparison & Evaluation**  
   - Compared **solution quality** (cost minimization) and **runtime efficiency** between ILP and GA.  
   - Conducted multiple runs for statistical reliability.
